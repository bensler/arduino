After purchasing and testing an air pressure powered water rocket I am going to send an Arduino equipped electronic payload into the air.

Potential applications are
* LEDs as eye candy and fireworks without fire
* data logging using an inertial sensor to see how air pressure and aamount of water influence flight hight
* deploy a parachute at the highest point of the flight path to make the impact less voilent and save the payload 

As a preliminary work some experiments have to be done
* log data from a inertial sensor to an SD card
* <a href="poti_servo">controlling a servo motor</a>
* let LEDs reflect certain sensor readings
* make everything run on batteries
