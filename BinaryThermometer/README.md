DS18B20 temperature sensor values being displayed as binary number on a WS2812 RGB LED strip.

Positive temperature readings are shown in red, negatives in blue. A binary 1 is represented
by a bright LED, a 0 by an LED at about 10% of that brightness. This makes the whole thing
more readable (or readable at all) in darkness. A potentiometer allows adjusting LED brightness
via analog input. 

Everything is controlled by an Arduino Nano brain. YEAH!
